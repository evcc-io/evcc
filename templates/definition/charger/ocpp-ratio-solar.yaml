      This charger only supports OCPP over secure websockets (wss://) with a signed certificate. To integrate it into evcc you'll need to setup a proxy that is capable of proxying websockets using SSL (such as nginx). Setting up OCPP is done in the Ratio app:

      * Go to "Charger settings" -> "Advanced settings" -> "OCPP settings"
      * Go to "Charge Point Operator" and select "Custom"
      * Url: wss://[proxy-domain]
      * Save and turn on OCPP, the CPID can be used as station id
